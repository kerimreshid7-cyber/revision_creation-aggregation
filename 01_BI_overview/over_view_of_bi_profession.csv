**Business Intelligence (BI) Profession — Overview**
Business Intelligence (BI) is a field in information technology that focuses on transforming raw business
 data into meaningful information that helps organizations make better decisions. 
 A BI professional does not only work with charts and dashboards, but mainly works with data to understand what is happening inside a company and why it is happening.
In real companies, many daily activities generate data such as sales transactions, customer registrations,
 inventory movements, and financial operations. However, this data alone is not useful unless it is organized, 
 cleaned, and analyzed. The role of a BI professional is to collect data from different sources(databases,
  systems, files), prepare it, analyze it, and present insights in a simple way for managers and decision makers.
One important responsibility of BI professionals is writing queries using SQL to extract information from databases.
 For example, they may calculate total sales per month, identify the most profitable products, or compare performance
  between branches. After analysis, they often use visualization tools like dashboards to communicate results clearly.
The BI profession requires both technical and business understanding. Technical skills include databases, SQL, data modeling, 
and visualization tools. Business understanding is also important because the goal is to solve real business problems such as 
increasing profit, reducing costs, or improving customer satisfaction.
In many industries such as trade companies, e-commerce, banking, healthcare, and telecommunications, BI plays a critical 
role in decision making. Organizations rely on BI professionals to identify trends, detect problems, and support strategic planning.
In conclusion, Business Intelligence is a bridge between data and decision making. A BI professional helps organizations move from
 guessing to informed decisions by using data analysis and reporting techniques.
